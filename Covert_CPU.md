## What It Does
The CPU is the primary component of every computer. It processes instructions and runs the operating system(OS) as well as its applications/software. The CPU is constantly receiving and sending constant input/outputing to and from both active software programs and the user. Each CPU contains at least on processor, this is the chip inside the CPU that performs all its calculations. 

## The Breakdown 

* CPU speed is measured in gigahertz(GHz) denotes how many instructions a CPU can handle per second.
* Multi-Threading: essencialy creates virtual CPU cores/chips to use.
* CPU's now normally have multiple cores. More cores = performing more instructions at once.
