### Hard Disk Drives
Hard disk drives have been around for over 50 years, continuously increasing their storage capacity while decreasing their physical size. HDDs use spinning disks, also called platters, to read and write data. 

### Solid State Drives
SSDs rely on electronic storage in non-volatile memory, meaning that data wonâ€™t disappear when the computer is turned off. It works by putting the saved data in a block that must be refreshed when any of it is updated. The data on the old block is copied over to a different block, the original block is then erased, the data is then rewritten with the changes to a new block.

### The Breakdown
| Drive        | Cost    | Speed  | Durability        | Highest Capacity    | Energy Efficiency  |
| ------------- |:--------:| -----:| ------------- |:--------:| -----:|  
| HDD      | Cheap | Slower | Less Durable | 10 TB | Less Efficient |
| SSD      | Expensive | Faster | More Durable | 4 TB | More Efficient |
