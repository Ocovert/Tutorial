# PC Parts Tutorial
##### _By Orrie Covert_

For my Final Project for INFOTC 2600 I am creating a tutorial on the different core components that make up any computer or laptop. I will be describing what each components role as well as what specifications too be knowledgeable on.  I will also include helpful tools at the end for building or buying yor own computer. 

This tutorial is for anyone looking to purchase/build their own computer or just want to be more knowledgeable on computer hardware.
