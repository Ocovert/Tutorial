# Computer Components Tutorial
##### By Orrie Covert

For my Final Project for INFOTC 2600 I am creating a tutorial on the different core components that make up any computer or laptop. I will be describing what each parts role is in the machine as well as what specifications too be knowledgable on. I will also include helpful tools for building yor own computer.
