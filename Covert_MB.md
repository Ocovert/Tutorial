# The Mother Board
_One ring to rule them all, and in the darkness bind them._

## What It Does
The Motherboad is the central hub for all the computers different components. It is the piece that brings all the other components together so that the computer can run. The computers RAM, CPU, Graphics Card, Memory Drives, power Supply, USBs, CD's, everything is connected to this. The Motherboard itself is a printed circuit board that allows all these components talk to eachother and share data using the mother boards chipset. Motherboards come in different shapes and sizes, referred to as "forms", depending on the computer it will be going into. Motherboards also provide a crucial function called the systems basic input/output system(BIOS).


## The Breakdown
Motherboards are all pretty similar. That being said, aspecs you need to be aware of are its form(if building a computer), chipset(so it can handle new hardware if upgrading), and its slots(for upgrading and optimum hardware compatability).
