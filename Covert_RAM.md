## **What Does RAM Do?**

RAM comes in varius shapes and sizes depending on the computer. RAM comes in sticks and rang between 1GB to a whoping 128GB. What RAM does is store temporary information, supporting the numerous different tasks your computer is running. Diffrent things require different amounts of RAM as well, ex. Microsoft Word uses less RAM than Adobe Photoshop. It's where the operating system(OS) stores application programs and data currently in use so that it can be quickly reached by the device's processor. An example of this would be the undo button when using an application or when a computer executes code. This means that the more RAM you have the more data you will be able to work with simultaneously. The more RAM you have the more efficient your CPU, thus making the computer faster. If you don't have a sufficient amount of RAM then your CPU has to work much harder to transfer data, which severally damages the computer's performance and its lifespan.

## **The Breakdown**
* The amount of RAM you need varies on what the computer will be doing. The average computer have between 4GB-16GB of RAM.

* Double Data Rate(DDR) represents the type of RAM. Each one doubling the data and transfer rates of the previous.
