## What is it ?
A computers graphics/video card is a circuit board that plugs into your computers motherboard. Its job is to convert data related to graphics into a signal that your monitor can understand and then display as images on the users screen. These cards contain their own random access memory(RAM), cooling unit, and their own processor chip called a graphics processing unit(GPU), similar to a CPU. Although, these cards are not essential for a computer to run. If the user does not have a graphics card the computers images and display will be rendered on the computers central processing unit(CPU), which can make the computer slower.

## Noticeable Impacts _(with a sufficient monitor)_ 
* Frame Rate - The frequency at which frames on a users screen can be displayed
* System Graphics - Renders higher quality 3D and 2D images
* No screen tearing
* Faster VideoEditing

## The Breakdown
Graphics/Video Cards are extremely helpful for any computer system no matter what. Just know that more memory(RAM) and more cores(GPUs), essentially, means higher quality and higher price.
